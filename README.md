# Bintoolz
One day I decided I don't want to remember assembler parameters. This is
the result.

## WIP
You can track my attempts at playing CTF by commits in this repository -
I create the tools I need (currently only a little wrapper around NASM
and objcopy

## Usage
Run install.sh, follow instructions (should only ask you to add alias
to your `.bashrc`

After installing, you can start the "Bintoolz Shell" by executing the
alias (bintoolz-shell by default). From there you can run bintoolz tools
